- 👋 Hi, I’m @retailwarrior
- 👀 I’m interested in mmostly my profession and my family. I am passionate about people and I am eager to always learn something new.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write code on my own in order to create collections and prograams. Hopefully I will be able to learn enough to write a basic training platform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that pertains to codeing and training. I am a blank slate but very coachable.
- 📫 How to reach me - Contact me via email bking011@gmail.com
